## How the Spaced Repetition Algorithm Works 🧠

The **spaced repetition algorithm** is designed to boost long-term retention by scheduling reviews of new information at gradually increasing intervals. 
- **First Review**: A card is reviewed shortly after it’s learned to prevent forgetting.
- **Adaptive Intervals**: Correct answers increase the time between reviews, consolidating memory. 🕒
- **Challenging Cards**: The algorithm reduces intervals for difficult cards, ensuring frequent review. 

This system focuses your attention on what matters most, streamlining study sessions and improving learning outcomes.
